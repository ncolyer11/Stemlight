# Stemlight
A collection of huge fungi/nether tree farm related calculators and simulators combined under the alias 'Stemlight'.

To get started, simply download the latest .zip file containing the executable program in [Releases](https://github.com/ncolyer11/Stemlight/releases) or if you'd like to build it yourself then run the build.bat (or .sh for Linux) script after installing the required packages using `poetry install` or similiar

Windows will have the latest release as I'll be updating Linux on a much slower cycle.

## Features
